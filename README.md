# Taxi_demand_prediction_NYC_project

### Context
The yellow taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP).

## Information on taxis:

<h5> Yellow Taxi: Yellow Medallion Taxicabs</h5>
<p> These are the famous NYC yellow taxis that provide transportation exclusively through street-hails. The number of taxicabs is limited by a finite number of medallions issued by the TLC. You access this mode of transportation by standing in the street and hailing an available taxi with your hand. The pickups are not pre-arranged.</p>

<h5> For Hire Vehicles (FHVs) </h5>
<p> FHV transportation is accessed by a pre-arrangement with a dispatcher or limo company. These FHVs are not permitted to pick up passengers via street hails, as those rides are not considered pre-arranged. </p>

<h5> Green Taxi: Street Hail Livery (SHL) </h5>
<p>  The SHL program will allow livery vehicle owners to license and outfit their vehicles with green borough taxi branding, meters, credit card machines, and ultimately the right to accept street hails in addition to pre-arranged rides. </p>

<h5>Note:</h5>
In the given notebook we are considering only the yellow taxis for the time period between Jan - Mar 2015 & Jan - Mar 2016

# Data Collection:
I have collected all yellow taxi trips data from jan-2015 to dec-2016(Will be using only 2015 data)

## Data Cleaning:
1. Univariate analysis of the data is performed wherein all erroneous data was removed.
2. As a part of the data cleaning phase we check if the pick-up and dropoff latitude and longitude fall within NYC and remove the ones that don’t.
3. I also removed outliers based on fare prices, Trip Duration, Speed and Distance travelled.

## Data-Preperation:

1. Clustering/Segmentation
As a part of our solution is to predict the pickups in a region within some time interval, we need to derive regions and time intervals from data.Lets begin with dividing NYC into K clusters using the latitude and longitude of pickups. Using K-Means clustering, we cluster the pick-up points into different regions.

From the data, we observe that a taxi can cover up to 2 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, we want the inner cluster distance to be greater than 2 miles but not lesser than 0.5 miles. The optimal K value must meet this constraint. We tried a range of different cluster values from 30 to 70 clusters. After trying a different range of clusters, we observed that when the number of clusters is 40.

2. Time Binning
Every region is split into 10-minute interval, which corresponds to one time bin, i.e. each time bin has 10 minute. However, in the data we have time in the format “YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS which are converted to Unix time format so as to retrieve time in minute/hour format. Number of possible 10 min interval bins : 4464 bins

3. Smoothing
Now that the data is divided into 10-minute interval bins, each bin should contain at least one pickup. There are chances that a time bin may contain zero pick-ups leading to ratio feature error.
